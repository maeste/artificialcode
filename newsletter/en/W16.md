# AI Weekly Trends, Highly Opinionated Signals from the Week \[W16\]

Hi all,

Back with another dose of AI happenings that caught my attention this week\! As usual, these are my personal observations from diving into articles, papers, and products that seem to be forming patterns worth paying attention to.

These takes are opinionated, incomplete, and absolutely open for debate. That's the whole point: I'm hoping to spark conversations, not deliver final verdicts. Feel free to challenge, add to, or completely disagree with anything below\!

Let's dive in ðŸ‘‡

## Agentic AI: From Lab to Reality (But Mind the Gap)

The buzz around agentic AI is deafening right now, but here's my take: while the technology is fascinating, enterprise adoption follows a very predictable pattern. Companies are (wisely) approaching agents with caution, focusing on low-risk use cases where failure is either quickly detectable or has minimal impact. Think AI coding assistants or deep research rather than mission-critical workflows.

OpenAI's [Practical Guide to Building Agents](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf) is a significant milestone here, it formalizes what constitutes an agent, when to build one, and (importantly) how to keep it on the rails. Similarly, GitHub's [12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) repository brings much-needed software engineering discipline to this wild west. Weaviate's breakdown of [agentic workflows](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-are-agentic-workflows) offers practical patterns that show how to move beyond basic RAG to truly orchestrated systems.

Where things get really interesting is the protocol layer. If agents are the *what*, protocols are becoming the *how*. We're seeing a fascinating stack emerge where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how tools are described, while Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol enables different AI systems to communicate securely. Google Cloud's [Next 25 announcements](https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/google-cloud-next-25-recap/) highlight this with their new specialized AI agents platform and A2A protocol implementation.

Some call this duo "the USB-C for AI" in [this illuminating article](https://medium.com/@the_manoj_desai/the-power-duo-how-a2a-mcp-let-you-build-practical-ai-systems-today-9c19064b027b), promising interoperability across vendors. But it's not all roses, there are legitimate concerns around [security issues](https://blog.sshh.io/p/everything-wrong-with-mcp) like prompt-injection surfaces and ambiguous authentication. The MCP community is growing rapidly though, with implementations popping up everywhere.

For the academically inclined, [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03767) on agentic meta-reasoning is absolutely worth a read to understand where this field might be heading.

## Vibe Coding: The Dance Between Human and AI

Why are coding agents the first to gain real traction? Simple: the feedback loop is crystal clear. Code either works or it doesn't. It either compiles or crashes. While there are certainly nuances around efficiency, elegance, and maintainability, the basic evaluation is much more straightforward than in other domains.

I've personally pushed these tools to their limits, and found an expected pattern. When I gave a vibe coding tool complete autonomy for a complex task, I burned through a small fortune in API costs for mediocre results. But when I changed approach (using it as a pair programmer with frequent check-ins and steering the process with hints) the efficiency and quality skyrocketed.

The model capabilities matter enormously here, particularly context window size. It's no coincidence that Claude extended to 200k tokens with Sonnet 3.7, while Google and OpenAI have pushed to 1M tokens with Gemini 2.5 and GPT-4.1. Larger context means the model can juggle more source files and maintain a better understanding of your codebase.

The impact is already tangible: Salesforce reports that its [Agentforce now writes 20% of their production code](https://venturebeat.com/ai/this-ai-already-writes-20-of-salesforces-code-heres-why-developers-arent-worried/), with developers shifting focus to architecture and user experience. While [LogRocket's explainer](https://blog.logrocket.com/what-is-vibe-coding/) offers a solid definition of vibe coding as design-first development. Another important note to add is that the current tools are still optimized for individual developers rather than large team collaboration, though [Cline's memory bank](https://docs.cline.bot/improving-your-prompting-skills/cline-memory-bank) shows promising steps in that direction.

Every major AI company is pouring resources into this area: Google with Firebase AI assistant, OpenAI releasing GPT-4.1 optimized for code and massive context windows, plus their [Flex Processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing?utm_source=tldrai) to reduce costs, and the release of [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) hot on the heels of Claude Code. And let's not forget OpenAI's flirtation with code assistant startups, first courting Cursor and now reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Windsurf for a whopping $3B. The message is clear: **AI-assisted coding is where the rubber meets the road.**

## Models That Think Visually (and Talk to Dolphins?)

OpenAI's latest releases are genuinely impressive, especially the reasoning models o3 and o4-mini. I've tested them myself, and their ability to reason through problems (particularly with images) feels like a qualitative leap forward. The models can [perform visual reasoning](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/1qIMWq) by zooming, cropping, and analyzing images in a step-by-step fashion.

User reactions have been similarly enthusiastic, with [Every.to's](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/vibe-check-o3-is-out-and-it-s-great) describing o3 as *fast, agentic, extremely smart, and with great vibes*, suggesting we've reached a point where the technology finally feels not just impressive but genuinely useful.

Meanwhile, Google released Gemini 2.5 Flash, focusing on improved *dynamic thinking* capabilities in a more cost-efficient package. Anthropic seems to be taking a different approach, doubling down on enterprise integration with Google Workspace, making Claude capable of accessing your emails, documents, and spreadsheets: it could fundamentally change daily productivity, and already changed mine.

In what might be the most unexpected application, Google DeepMind is even [teaching AI to communicate with dolphins](https://blog.google/technology/ai/dolphingemma/) through their DolphinGemma project. The intersection of multimodal understanding and interspecies communication is simultaneously whimsical and profound.

## Robotics: Where AI Gets Physical

The fusion of AI and robotics continues to accelerate, with Hugging Face making a particularly bold move by [acquiring Pollen Robotics](https://fortune.com/2025/04/14/ai-company-hugging-face-buys-humanoid-robot-company-pollen-robotics-reachy-2), the creators of the Reachy 2 humanoid robot. This acquisition highlights how the boundaries between AI software and physical embodiment are blurring.

What's particularly exciting is seeing how the open-source ethos that has transformed AI is now influencing robotics. Just as open-weight models democratised access to powerful language models, open robotics platforms could do the same for embodied AI. Open-source always win.

The research activity in this space is incredibly vibrant. Just in the past month, we've seen groundbreaking papers on [robot learning from human feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22444), [tactile intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00957), [vision-language foundation models for robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20020), [reinforcement learning for manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19941), [multitask learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16579), and [planning with 3D scene understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17061).

The pace of innovation here suggests we might see consumer and industrial robotics advance much faster than expected, particularly as these systems leverage the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to make sense of real-world environments.

## Deep Dive Into the Rabbit Hole

Starting with this issue, I'll include some resources for those who want to dive deeper into the fundamentals of this rapidly changing field. After all, keeping up with terminology and core concepts is becoming a challenge in itself\!

For a solid introduction, I highly recommend this article on [key generative AI concepts](https://generativeprogrammer.com/p/key-generative-ai-concepts-every) that every software engineer should understand. It provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the terminology and ideas driving current innovations. It is from a colleague, Bilgin Ibryam, and I could not do this better.

For those ready to go much deeper into the mathematics and technology behind LLMs, check out this excellent book: [study guide](https://leanpub.com/transformers-large-language-models/). If you already know concepts and wnat something very concise to keep on your desktop, there you go: Stanford [cheat sheet on transformers and language models](https://github.com/afshinea/stanford-cme-295-transformers-large-language-models/blob/main/en/cheatsheet-transformers-large-language-models.pdf). These resources break down complex concepts into digestible pieces, helping bridge the gap between high-level discussion and technical implementation.

That's all for this week\! As always, I welcome your feedback, different perspectives, counterarguments, and discussion. The goal here isn't to declare truths but to spark conversations. So if anything resonated (or didn't), let's talk about it\!

Until next time,

Stefano

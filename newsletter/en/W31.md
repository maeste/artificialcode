### What's been going on this week?

The landscape of AI coding assistants is maturing rapidly, and [Meta's revolutionary decision to allow AI in coding interviews](https://www.neowin.net/news/meta-is-stepping-into-the-future-by-allowing-candidates-to-use-ai-in-coding-tests-soon/) marks a watershed moment. They're currently running experimental mock interviews where candidates can use AI assistants, recognizing that modern development environments will always include these tools. This isn't about making interviews easier; it's about testing real-world skills. As Mark Zuckerberg predicted on Joe Rogan's podcast, by 2025 we'll have AI that functions like mid-level engineers writing production code.

Meanwhile, [Anthropic's teams are demonstrating how Claude Code transforms workflows across entire organizations](https://www.anthropic.com/news/how-anthropic-teams-use-claude-code), from legal departments building accessibility tools to data scientists creating complex visualizations without learning JavaScript. Their security engineering team reduced debugging time from 15 minutes to 5 minutes by feeding Claude Code stack traces and documentation. The growth marketing team achieved 10x creative output by automating ad generation workflows that previously took hours.

For those looking to maximize their effectiveness with these tools, [Sajal Sharma's comprehensive guide on working with AI coding assistants](https://sajalsharma.com/posts/effective-ai-coding/) provides battle-tested strategies. The key insight: we're shifting from code writers to system architects. Your value now lies in understanding component interactions, identifying bottlenecks, and making architectural decisions while AI handles implementation mechanics. Sharma emphasizes treating specifications as first-class deliverables, maintaining them in version control alongside your code.

Understanding how these models improve is crucial, and [Addy Osmani's deep dive into AI code model evaluations](https://addyosmani.com/blog/ai-evals/) explains the "hill climbing" approach that drives continuous improvement. Evals are essentially unit tests for AI models, measuring functional correctness through pass rates on coding tasks. Teams iterate by analyzing failures, adding targeted training data, and re-evaluating. This cycle mirrors agile development: implement, measure, learn, repeat.

However, success brings challenges. [Anthropic has introduced new weekly rate limits for Claude Code](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/anthropic-unveils-new-rate-limits-to-curb-claude-code-power-users/), effective August 28th, affecting less than 5% of subscribers who run it 24/7. Pro users can expect 40-80 hours of Sonnet 4 weekly, while Max plan subscribers get significantly more. This move reflects the massive computational costs of serving advanced AI models and mirrors similar adjustments across the industry.

The competitive landscape is intensifying. [Chinese startup Z.ai launched GLM-4.5](https://venturebeat.com/ai/chinese-startup-z-ai-launches-powerful-open-source-glm-4-5-model-family-with-powerpoint-creation/), an open-source powerhouse with 355 billion parameters that undercuts DeepSeek while approaching the performance of leading models in reasoning, coding, and autonomous tasks. It combines these capabilities in a single model with hybrid thinking for balancing speed versus task difficulty, positioning itself as the top open-source model globally.

Not to be outdone, [Mistral unveiled Codestral 25.08 and a complete enterprise coding stack](https://mistral.ai/news/codestral-25-08), addressing critical gaps in deployment, customization, observability, and toolchain integration. Their platform enables AI-native software development across regulated and complex environments, with features like self-hosted deployment, SSO integration, and usage observability. Major enterprises like Capgemini and SNCF are already using it in production.

## üß† Agents: context is all you need

### Key Takeaways for AI Engineers
- **Context engineering trumps prompt engineering:** Focus on providing the right information at each step rather than perfecting individual prompts
- **Build for model improvement:** Design agent architectures that can leverage better models as they arrive without major refactoring
- **Master distributed context management:** Success with multi-agent systems requires careful orchestration of prompts and context across agents
- **Action Items:**
  - Implement context management patterns in your agent projects
  - Study the MCP and A2A for agent-tools and inter-agent communication standards

### What's been going on this week?

I love the [LinkedIn post that sparked an important realization: "Prompt is all you need"](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maeste_a-good-question-asked-is-prompting-or-training-activity-7355934749695049728--mgq). The paper it references provides concrete evidence that prompting functions like training at inference time, similar to applying a low-rank matrix to the model. This means prompting is all you need for 90% of use cases. This perspective fundamentally changes how we think about model optimization and computational efficiency. ANd my own extension to this concept is that "Context is all you need"

[Google announced improvements to the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/agent2agent-protocol-is-getting-an-upgrade/), reaching version 0.3.0. I'm proud of my team's contributions to the specification, Java SDK, TCK, and multi-language samples. The protocol enables sophisticated agent collaboration, and Google Cloud's tools help developers build, deploy, and sell collaborative A2A systems. These updates significantly enhance how AI agents communicate and collaborate.

Building production agents requires more than great prompts. The [six principles for production AI agents](https://www.app.build/blog/six-principles-production-ai-agents) emphasize proper system design and software engineering. Focus on clear instructions, lean context management, robust tool interfaces, and automated validation loops instead of searching for the perfect prompt or advanced framework. Error analysis is critical: use models to understand failure modes so they can be systematically addressed.

[Context engineering for agents](https://rlancemartin.github.io/2025/06/23/context_engineering/) is the art and science of providing agents with the right information at each step. It involves supplying appropriate instructions, knowledge, and tools to optimize output while reducing token usage. The four common approaches are: writing context, selecting context, compressing context, and isolating context. Mastering these patterns is central to building effective agents.

Finally, [learning the bitter lesson](https://rlancemartin.github.io/2025/07/30/bitter_lesson/) reminds us that AI application design philosophy is still nascent. We can predict models will improve dramatically, so designing applications to leverage this improvement is crucial. Understand your application's structure, re-evaluate as models improve, and make it easy to remove structure when models can handle tasks independently.

## ü§ñ Multimodality for fun and for learning

### Key Takeaways for AI Engineers
- **Video generation matures rapidly:** From photos to animations, multimodal capabilities are becoming production-ready
- **Educational applications lead adoption:** NotebookLM's video overviews show how multimodality enhances learning and comprehension
- **Prepare for multimodal reasoning:** Future models will use visual tokens for reasoning, similar to how humans think with diagrams
- **Action Items:**
  - Experiment with video generation APIs for product demos
  - Integrate multimodal features into documentation workflows

### What's been going on this week?

Video generation models continue their breakneck evolution, matching coding as the fastest-growing niche since year's start. [Google Photos now animates static images into six-second clips](https://blog.google/products/photos/photo-to-video-remix-create-tab/) using their Veo 2 AI model, bringing photos to life with natural-looking movement. Every generated video includes visible labels and invisible watermarks to indicate AI generation, maintaining transparency while enabling creative possibilities.

[Runway's new Aleph model](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-runway-aleph) takes a different approach, functioning as an "in-context" video editor that modifies existing footage through text prompts. It can generate new camera angles from single shots, apply style transfers while maintaining scene coherence, add or remove elements, re-light scenes, create green screen masks, and generate the next shot in sequences. This represents a shift from generation to intelligent manipulation.

But multimodality isn't just for viral posts. [Google's Video Overviews in NotebookLM](https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-video-overviews-studio-upgrades/) transforms complex source material into concise AI-generated videos, helping users grasp key ideas faster. This feature synthesizes documents, research, and reference materials into easily digestible video format, making learning more accessible and engaging.

The open-source community isn't sitting idle. [Alibaba's Tongyi Lab launched Wan2.2](https://deepmind.google/models/veo/), bringing advanced cinematic capabilities and high-quality motion for both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. Using two specialized "experts" (one for general scenes, another for fine details), it maintains efficiency while surpassing competitors including Seedance, Hailuo, Kling, and Sora in aesthetics, text rendering, and camera control.

Stay tuned for the next evolution: multimodal content (images and video) will soon serve as reasoning tokens. Just as we think better when sketching diagrams or simulating situations, models will leverage visual thinking for complex problem-solving.

### What's been going on this week?

Competition in AI infrastructure is heating up. [Nvidia challenger Groq is nearing $600 million in new funding at a $6 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/nvidia-ai-chip-challenger-groq-said-to-be-nearing-new-fundraising-at-6b-valuation/), led by Austin's Disruptive. Having previously raised about $1 billion (with BlackRock leading the November round), Groq represents serious competition to Nvidia's monopoly. Google's TPUs provide another alternative, and healthy competition drives innovation forward.

The business metrics are staggering. [OpenAI hit $12 billion in annualized revenue](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-hits-12-billion-annualized-revenue-breaks-700-million-chatgpt-weekly-active-users), roughly doubling in the first seven months of the year. They're generating $1 billion monthly with 700 million weekly active users. However, their cash burn projection increased to $8 billion for 2025, up $1 billion from previous estimates.

Menlo Ventures' [2025 Mid-Year LLM Market Update](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-mid-year-llm-market-update/) reveals fascinating trends. API spending for foundation models more than doubled in six months, with companies shifting from development to production inference. Code generation has become AI's first breakout use case. Notably, Anthropic has surpassed others in enterprise market share, particularly for coding applications. While open source advances, Western labs see slowing frontier discoveries, consolidating enterprise dollars around few high-performance closed-source models.

[Apple is getting serious about AI strategy](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/tim-cook-apple-ai-acquisitions.html), with Tim Cook confirming they're "very open" to acquisitions of any size to develop AI offerings. Beyond growing investments, Apple is reorganizing staff internally to focus more on AI, responding to Wall Street pressure to catch up with Silicon Valley peers.

[Mistral's Codestral 25.08 enterprise coding stack](https://mistral.ai/news/codestral-25-08) deserves another mention here for its business implications. By addressing deployment, customization, observability, and toolchain integration gaps, Mistral positions itself as Anthropic's main competitor in the enterprise market. Their solution enables AI-native development across regulated environments with enterprise-grade security and compliance support.

## üöÄ AI is changing the web

### Key Takeaways for AI Engineers
- **Browser agents arrive:** ChatGPT's agent capabilities and Microsoft's Copilot Mode signal the future of web interaction
- **Search evolves fundamentally:** Google's query fan-out technique changes both how we find and consume information
- **Privacy concerns intensify:** Public ChatGPT queries getting indexed raises important questions about AI conversation privacy
- **Action Items:**
  - Test browser automation capabilities for repetitive tasks
  - Experiment with chatGPT agent (or at least with something similar) to get the potential

### What's been going on this week?

I've tested ChatGPT's agent on fairly simple tasks and I'm impressed. While not perfect, the range of capabilities is remarkable. With more maturity, many browser-based tasks will be delegated to similar agents. I've included [Leon Furze's critical analysis](https://leonfurze.com/2025/07/21/everything-ive-learned-so-far-about-openais-agents/) because there's certainly room for improvement, but my user experience has been positive. The agent works about one-third of the time on first attempt, requiring guidance or manual intervention otherwise.

[Microsoft enters the AI browser market with Copilot Mode in Edge](https://blogs.microsoft.com/), bringing AI assistance directly into browsing for searching across open tabs, managing tasks, and proactively suggesting actions. Launching free for a limited time on Windows and Mac, it integrates voice control and multi-tab analysis directly into the browsing experience.

Google awaits antitrust decisions before making Chrome moves but is fundamentally transforming search. Their [query fan-out technique in AI Mode](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/query-fan-out-technique-in-ai-mode-new-details-from-google/552532/) uses large language models to interpret queries and "fan out" to multiple related searches, including topics users never explicitly mentioned. This changes not just how we find content but how we search in the first place.

Privacy concerns are mounting as [public ChatGPT queries are getting indexed by Google and other search engines](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/your-public-chatgpt-queries-are-getting-indexed-by-google-and-other-search-engines/). OpenAI removed the feature that allowed users to make conversations publicly discoverable, calling it a "short-lived experiment." This raises significant implications for user privacy and questions about how AI companies manage and index user data.

The transformation of web interaction through AI is accelerating. From automated browsing to evolved search paradigms, we're witnessing fundamental changes in how humans interact with digital information. The key for engineers is understanding these shifts to build applications that leverage rather than resist these new patterns.

# Interview Briefing Generator

Generate professional interview briefings through a structured workflow that transforms research into actionable preparation documents.

## Core Workflow

Follow this 5-step process sequentially:

### Step 1: Gather Basic Information

Collect from user:
- **Interviewee name** (full name)
- **Role and organization** 
- **Interview duration** (suggest: 30-45 min / 60 min / 90 min)
- **Number of thematic blocks** (suggest based on duration: 30-45min→3-4 / 60min→4-5 / 90min→5-7)

### Step 2: Collect Context Materials

Request from user:
- **URLs**: LinkedIn, personal sites, articles, previous interviews, talks
- **Uploaded files**: PDFs, transcripts, presentations
- **Additional context**: Interview goals, target audience, tone preference

**Critical**: Use `web_fetch` for all URLs provided. Use `view` for uploaded files. Collect ALL materials before proceeding.

### Step 3: Analyze Context

After gathering all materials:
1. Extract biographical information (role, education, key experiences)
2. Identify recurring themes in their work
3. Extract 5-7 significant quotes with full context
4. Note their communication style and expertise areas
5. Find proprietary concepts/frameworks they've created

### Step 4: Propose Block Structure

Present a structured proposal for each block:

```
BLOCCO [N]: [Title] ([Duration] minutes)

Focus: [What this block explores]

Themes to cover:
• [Theme 1]
• [Theme 2]
• [Theme 3]

Possible main questions:
→ [Question option A]
→ [Question option B]
```

**Important**: Always make Block 1 about identity/journey and final block about future/actions. Wait for user approval before proceeding.

### Step 5: Generate Complete Briefing

Once structure is approved, generate the full briefing following the template structure in `references/template.md`.

## Question Formulation Pattern

Every main question must follow this structure:

```
"[CONTEXT about person/work] + [CONNECTION to quote/article] + 
[SPECIFIC QUESTION] + [REQUEST for concrete example/depth]"
```

**Example of strong question**:
```
"In your recent article you write that 'AI is a character test'. 
This is very different from mainstream narrative. Can you share 
a concrete case where you saw AI reveal someone's human qualities 
rather than replace them?"
```

**Avoid weak questions**:
- Generic: "What do you think about AI?"
- Yes/no: "Do you like your job?"
- Without context: "Tell me about your work"

## Key Resources

**Must read before starting**:
- `references/template.md` - Complete briefing structure to follow
- `references/guide.md` - Detailed best practices for each section
- `references/example.md` - Fully compiled briefing example

**When structure questions arise**:
- View `assets/structure_diagram.png` for visual overview

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering final briefing, verify:
- [ ] 5-7 significant quotes with explanations
- [ ] Each block has main question + 5-7 exploration points
- [ ] Question follows CONTEXT→CITATION→QUESTION→DEPTH pattern
- [ ] Total timing matches requested duration
- [ ] Conducting notes include communication style
- [ ] No generic placeholders remain

## Output Format

Generate as single markdown document ready for download. After generation, ask user:
```
Would you like me to:
1. Create downloadable .md file
2. Modify specific sections
3. Generate supplementary materials (slides, opening script, etc.)
```

## Common Adjustments

**If limited context provided**:
- Ask specific questions to extract more
- Suggest where to find materials (LinkedIn, Google, etc.)
- Offer to use web_search
- If truly minimal, generate with marked `[TO COMPLETE]` sections

**For non-standard durations**:
- Very brief (15-30 min): 2-3 essential blocks only
- Very long (120+ min): Consider mini-breaks between blocks

**For technical interviews**:
- Add "Technical Setup and Demo" section
- Include questions on specific stack/tools
- Prepare technical scenarios to discuss
